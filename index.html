                Will you fly to my bedroom tonight? <br/>
                I'll be waiting up with the light on<br/>
                Will you shine by my window tonight?<br/>
                The second start to the right, oh <br/>
                You are home to me <br/>
                You are everything I need <br/>
                Peter, I mean it - and I will believe it<br/>
                Again and again <br/>
                Take me back to Neverland <br/>
                    <br/>
                Will you read me a story tonight? <br/>
                I've been lying awake on my pillow, oh <br/>
                Promise I'll be good <br/>
                I'd never stomp or pout or brood <br/>
                Peter I mean it - and I will believe it <br/>
                Again and again <br/>
                Take me back to Neverland <br/>
                    <br/>
                Cuz the world feels darker <br/>
                The more I grow <br/>
                And the night gets colder <br/>
                Each time I wake up <br/>
                I don't have much to lose <br/>
                I only have you <br/>
                    <br/>
                You are home to me <br/>
                You are everything I need <br/>
                Peter, I mean it - and I will believe it <br/>
                Again and again <br/>
                Take me back to Neverland <br/>
                Take me back to Neverland <br/>
